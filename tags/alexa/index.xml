      <description>A Convenient MotivationI was introduced to Amazon Web Services (AWS) during my time at Quartet, and I found myself wanting to learn how to make the most out of the platform. At the same time, I had received four Amazon Echo Dots as a result of a promotional code mistake by Amazon that resulted in the Dot being sold for free.
What better way to leverage the two than a good old-fashioned Alexa Skill?</description>
