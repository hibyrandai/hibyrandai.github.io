<p>I’m getting back into writing again, and this time sticking with it. Daily updates, short blurbs, long-form pieces on particularly pensive days, you name it.</p>
<p>Our team continues to grow as more data specialists are sent over from our community agencies and ACCES-VR partnerships. It’s been a wonderful experience working with these men and women, and in particular it’s an opportunity to create a new corporate model for working with this population that provides professional development opportunities and strong productivity.</p>
<p>As I’ve spoke about the company, I’ve found myself attracing other passionate individuals across the clinical, engineering, and business spaces, and I’m proud to have two folks, Rahul and Maggie, stepping into even more direct roles in supporting Daivergent by contributing their extensive experiences in technology and healthcare.</p>
<p>It’s an uncertain time as Daivergent grows and I feel nervous, but something struck me as I was talking to a friend of mine that it comes down to a rough dichotomy: you either prefer stability, or you prefer uncertainty. I’ve had several jobs that offered a stable career with interesting opportunities, but I would feel incredible disappointment when I envisioned myself staying in that role for 30-40 years. It’s early with Daivergent, but in these past few months, I’ve felt the complete opposite. I’m awake at night a lot staring at my ceiling, I think about this company 24/7, and yet it all just feels right to me.</p>
<p>I crave that uncertainty, and if this is how I feel as I run this company, from today until they lower me into the ground, I’ll consider it to be a life well-lived.</p>
