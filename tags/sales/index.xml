      <description>Another month, another post. I will be diligent this time.
Our workforce is now three months, and as this quarter reaches a close, it presents a natural reflection point. For the first time, I have a settled routine for my team. Mondays are reserved for sprint planning and training, end of week 1-on-1s with my teams, daily breaks to get the blood going so nobody burns out from a tough day of data processing.</description>

      <description>I’m getting back into writing again, and this time sticking with it. Daily updates, short blurbs, long-form pieces on particularly pensive days, you name it.
Our team continues to grow as more data specialists are sent over from our community agencies and ACCES-VR partnerships. It’s been a wonderful experience working with these men and women, and in particular it’s an opportunity to create a new model from scratch. It’s a real chance to develop a novel model for how to work with this population that both provides professional development opportunities and brings out their full productivity.</description>
