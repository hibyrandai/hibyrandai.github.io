<p>“So what are you doing next?”</p>
<p>Like clockwork, this was the question I got asked when I’d tell someone I quit my job. A week and a half later, I’m still figuring out the right answer, the right way to phrase “I just want some protected time to build an idea.”</p>
<p>I left my Data Science position at Quartet Health the weekend before Thanksgiving. I felt the time was right to dive headfirst into a few projects that I had been bouncing around for a while, while also focusing heavily on strengthening my technical and programming skillsets. Though audibly vague when I share these rationales aloud to others, to me I feel there’s a clear plan in place.</p>
<p>I’m going to either:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>develop this new data collection service to compete with the likes of SurveyMonkey, Qualtrics, Google Forms, and move beyond the traditional survey Q&amp;A format into something far more flexible, or</p></li>
<li><p>build the next generation of group homes for adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD), addressing the signficant caregiver stress, growing prevalence of children with IDD transitioning into adulthood, and untapped potential of these adults to be contributing members of their communities.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>These represent two substantially different ideas, and I often phrase them as being my “professional” and my “personal” projects. As a data scientist and public health statistician, I know the frustrations of garbage data brimming with confounding biases and systematic flaws that make any conclusion derived from the data equally garbage. This has been a professional pet peeve for ages, and I find myself wanting to address this at the beginning of the data pipeline.</p>
<p>However, it doesn’t come close to the passion I feel when I talk about the need for adult group housing that goes beyond shelter and instead provides vocational opportunities and socialization to residents. In three years, my brother (Brandon) will age out of the New Jersey special education system, and with that goes his daily support and life skills training. Like the 500,000 families whose children will come of age in the next decade, our family will face a difficult choice about what setting will be most appropriate for Brandon. Currently, 900,000 individuals with IDD live with a primary caregiver over the age of 60, and my family is included in that statistic. The societal demand will only continue to grow.</p>
<p>I intend to chronicle the thought process and development of these ideas over the next twelve months. I can’t predict what will happen at the end, but I’m ready to get started on the journey.</p>
