      <description>Another month, another post. I will be diligent this time.
Our workforce is now three months, and as this quarter reaches a close, it presents a natural reflection point. For the first time, I have a settled routine for my team. Mondays are reserved for sprint planning and training, end of week 1-on-1s with my teams, daily breaks to get the blood going so nobody burns out from a tough day of data processing.</description>
