<p>Another month, another post. I will be diligent this time.</p>
<p>Our workforce is now three months, and as this quarter reaches a close, it presents a natural reflection point. For the first time, I have a settled routine for my team. Mondays are reserved for sprint planning and training, end of week 1-on-1s with my teams, daily breaks to get the blood going so nobody burns out from a tough day of data processing.</p>
<p>Always hiding underneath is the undercurrent of anxiety that I realize will never be put to rest. Each day brings new questions about what the next step will be after the contract in front of us. My conversations with NYSID and AHRC are promising and give me excitement, but I temper those feelings with the sobering reality that I’m boostrapping a shoestring team working its damn hardest to keep all the balls in the air.</p>
<p>I’ve grown to rely on this routine to increase efficiency. The team has a set lunch that they are welcome to join at 12:30 every day to socialize. At 3:30, we run through a brief 15 minute water cooler/coffee break to create three natural work chunks for work allocation. This has been crucial as the time I dedicate to sales, marketing, and outreach take up greater portions of my day. We are beginning the next training module on collaborative work with colleagues having different communication styles, and using quality assurance/auditing tasks as scenarios for the team to practice those skills.</p>
<p>As I’ve shared Daivergent’s story with more founders, investors, customers, and friends, I’ve noticed that the notion of a social enterprise that both has a clear path towards revenue and a high likelihood for impact resonates powerfully. In a conversation with one founder, I was told that he had heard enough before I even opened my mouth, and I “didn’t have to sell him.” That was a first, and I hope not the last. As I’ve said, our story gets us a foot in the door, but what remains is whether we’ll be let inside. Stigma, prejudice, and fear have not dissipated even in 2018, but I’m positive that Daivergent is taking the right steps to bring critical exposure of this population to corporate and startup America.</p>
<p>I’m on the right track and I have my eye towards scaling, but I worry about balancing this need to expand Daivergent’s impact with the importance of maintaining our mission of professional development for this population. We cannot just pack more bodies into an office, that’s not the future of work and it’s not a sustainble way to bring our vision to the rest of the country. I’m lucky to have a leadership team that is fully on-board with building that online, accessible platform which empowers all Americans with disabilities to contribute their talents. As I finalize our study this month of the performance of a remote workforce, I’m one hundred percent confident the team will exceed expectations.</p>
<p>WIth that data, we are limitless.</p>
