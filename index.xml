      <description>A Convenient MotivationI was introduced to Amazon Web Services (AWS) during my time at Quartet, and I found myself wanting to learn how to make the most out of the platform. At the same time, I had received four Amazon Echo Dots as a result of a promotional code mistake by Amazon that resulted in the Dot being sold for free.

      <description>“So what are you doing next?”
Like clockwork, this was the question I got asked when I’d tell someone I quit my job. A week and a half later, I’m still figuring out the right answer, the right way to phrase “I just want some protected time to build an idea.”
I left my Data Science position at Quartet Health the weekend before Thanksgiving. I felt the time was right to dive headfirst into a few projects that I had been bouncing around for a while, while also focusing heavily on strengthening my technical and programming skillsets.</description>
